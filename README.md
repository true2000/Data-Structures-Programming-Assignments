# Data-Structures-Programming-Assignments
A collection of assignments from my data structures class in spring 2022, code is using C but written in C++ (Using Zybooks CSCI 2683: Data Structures)
## [Programming Assignment #1](https://github.com/true2000/Data-Structures-Programming-Assignments/blob/main/Programming%20Assignment%20%231%20(Binary%20Search).cpp)
Binary Search

A boy goes to buy video games from a shop.The shop contains N unique video games.The prices of the games are given in the form of an array A.
The price of ith games is A[i].Now the boy has q queries, in each query he wants to know the number of unique games that have a price less than the given amount M.
## [Programming Assignment #2](https://github.com/true2000/Data-Structures-Programming-Assignments/blob/main/Programming%20Assignment%20%232%20(Sorting).cpp)
Sorting

Riverfield Country Day School will be hosting its Prom Night tonight. There would be M boys and N girls at the prom tonight. 
Each boy wants to dance with a girl who is strictly shorter than him. A girl can dance with only one boy and vice-versa. 
Given the heights of all the boys and girls tell whether it is possible for all boys to dance with a girl.
## [Programming Assignment #3](https://github.com/true2000/Data-Structures-Programming-Assignments/blob/main/Programming%20Assignment%20%233%20(Linked%20Lists).cpp)
Linked Lists

You are given a linked list that contains N integers. You are to perform the following reverse operation on the list:

Select all the subparts of the list that contain only even integers. For example, if the list is {1,2,8,9,12,16}, 
then the selected subparts will be {2,8}, {12,16}. Reverse the selected subpart such as {8,2} and {16,12}. The list should now be {1,8,2,9,16,12}.

Your node definition should consist of 2 elements: the integer value and a pointer to a node.
