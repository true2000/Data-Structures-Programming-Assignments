# Data-Structures-Programming-Assignments
A collection of assignments from my data structures class in spring 2022, code is using C but written in C++ (Using Zybooks CSCI 2683: Data Structures)
## Academic Integrity Policy
Students at Tulsa Community College are expected to behave as responsible members of the College community and to be honest and ethical in their academic work. TCC strives to provide students with the knowledge, skills, judgment, and critical thinking needed to function in society. To falsify or fabricate the results of one's research; to present the words, ideas, data, or work of another as one's own; or to cheat on an examination corrupts the essential process of higher education and is a disservice to the student, faculty, and staff community. All TCC community members share the responsibility and authority to challenge and report acts of academic dishonesty.

For more information please review [SH.02.A â€“ Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.tulsacc.edu/student-resources/student-handbook/academic-policies#sh-02-a)
## [Programming Assignment #1](https://github.com/true2000/Data-Structures-Programming-Assignments/blob/main/Programming%20Assignment%20%231%20(Binary%20Search).cpp)
Binary Search

A boy goes to buy video games from a shop.The shop contains N unique video games.The prices of the games are given in the form of an array A.
The price of ith games is A[i].Now the boy has q queries, in each query he wants to know the number of unique games that have a price less than the given amount M.
## [Programming Assignment #2](https://github.com/true2000/Data-Structures-Programming-Assignments/blob/main/Programming%20Assignment%20%232%20(Sorting).cpp)
Sorting

Riverfield Country Day School will be hosting its Prom Night tonight. There would be M boys and N girls at the prom tonight. 
Each boy wants to dance with a girl who is strictly shorter than him. A girl can dance with only one boy and vice-versa. 
Given the heights of all the boys and girls tell whether it is possible for all boys to dance with a girl.
## [Programming Assignment #3](https://github.com/true2000/Data-Structures-Programming-Assignments/blob/main/Programming%20Assignment%20%233%20(Linked%20Lists).cpp)
Linked Lists

You are given a linked list that contains N integers. You are to perform the following reverse operation on the list:

Select all the subparts of the list that contain only even integers. For example, if the list is {1,2,8,9,12,16}, 
then the selected subparts will be {2,8}, {12,16}. Reverse the selected subpart such as {8,2} and {16,12}. The list should now be {1,8,2,9,16,12}.

Your node definition should consist of 2 elements: the integer value and a pointer to a node.
## [Programming Assignment #4](https://github.com/true2000/Data-Structures-Programming-Assignments/blob/main/Programming%20Assignment%20%234%20(Stacks%20%26%20Queues).cpp)
Stacks & Queues

Along with the usual stack operations, you also need to implement some new ones. 
Like you may have to push given element 'n' times, or pop multiple times through a single function.

Input: The first line will contain one integer, q the number of queries. Next q lines follow.
Each line contains 5 types of queries
